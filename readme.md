# Batty's Coordinates PLUS! Mod

A Forge-compatible Minecraft client mod

## Combines Batty's Coordinates & Stopwatch Timer

### Batty's Coordinates
* The X, Y and Z coordinates that locate the player's position in the world are normally displayed on the F3 Debug screen.

* This mod has a number of display modes that present this information, and more, discreetly in a corner of the main game screen, so you don't have to leave F3 open to see them.

* In Mode 0 the Coordinates are hidden.

* Mode 1 shows the X, Y and Z coordinates, and it also indicates the direction that you are facing, in compass-direction terms.

* Mode 2 adds an indication whether your X and Z coordinates will Increase or Decrease if you move in the direction you are facing.

* Mode 3 also shows the Biome that you are currently in, displayed below the coordinates.

* Mode 4 replaces the normal X, Y and Z coordinates with Chunk information.

### Batty's Stop-watch
* A discreet timer tucked away in the corner of the screen, that you can hide, reappear, stop, start and zero using key presses.

* Can be used to time activities in-game. Useful for speed challenges.

* Shows the time passed in hours, minutes and seconds.

* Colour-coded so you know at a glance if it is stopped or running.

# Batty's Coordinates PLUS! Mod for Forge
Combines Batty's Coordinates & Stopwatch Timer

## Batty's Coordinates
The X, Y and Z coordinates that locate the player's position in the world are normally displayed on the F3 Debug screen.
This mod has a number of display modes that present this information, and more, discreetly in a corner of the main game screen, so you don't have to leave F3 open to see them.
In Mode 0 the Coordinates are hidden.
Mode 1 shows the X, Y and Z coordinates, and it also indicates the direction that you are facing, in compass-direction terms.
Mode 2 adds an indication whether your X and Z coordinates will Increase or Decrease if you move in the direction you are facing.
Mode 3 also shows the Biome that you are currently in, displayed below the coordinates.
Mode 4 replaces the normal X, Y and Z coordinates with Chunk information:
This shows which Chunk you are in, and which Block within that Chunk
The display appears with the Chunk being denoted by a 'c' and the Block by a 'b'.

## Batty's Stopwatch Timer

A discreet timer tucked away in a corner of the screen, that you can hide, reappear, stop, start and zero using key presses.
Can be used to time activities in-game. Useful for speed challenges.
Shows the time passed in hours, minutes and seconds.
Colour-coded so you know at a glance if it is stopped or running.

## FPS Display
The Frames per Second that the game is running at is now displayable in a corner of the screen, and can be hidden and made to reappear at the press of a button.

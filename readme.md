# Batty's Coordinates PLUS! Mod for Forge

A Forge-compatible Minecraft client mod

## Combines Batty's Coordinates & Stopwatch Timer

### Batty's Coordinates
The X, Y and Z coordinates that locate the player's position in the world are normally displayed on the F3 Debug screen.

This mod displays them discreetly in the top left-hand corner of the main game screen, so you don't have to leave F3 open to see them.

It also indicates the direction that you are facing, in compass-direction terms.

A further option indicates whether your X and Z coordinates will Increase or Decrease if you move in the direction you are facing.

Finally the Biome that you are currently in can be displayed below the coordinates.

<<size 16px>><<color 00ff00>>Chunks<</color>><</size>>

++From version 1.7.2 (2.3.2) onwards there is an additional view that shows which Chunk you are in, and which Block within that Chunk++ 

### Batty's Stop-watch
A discreet timer tucked away in the corner of the screen, that you can hide, reappear, stop, start and zero using key presses.

Can be used to time activities in-game. Useful for speed challenges.

Shows the time passed in hours, minutes and seconds.

Colour-coded so you know at a glance if it is stopped or running.

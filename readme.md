# Batty's Coordinates PLUS! Mod for Forge
Combines Batty's Coordinates, Stopwatch Timer & Info Panel

## Batty's Coordinates
The X, Y and Z coordinates that locate the player's position in the world are normally displayed on the F3 Debug screen.
This mod has a number of display modes that present this information, and more, discreetly in a corner of the main game screen, so you don't have to leave F3 open to see them.
In Mode 0 the Coordinates are hidden.
Mode 1 shows the X, Y and Z coordinates, and it also indicates the direction that you are facing, in compass-direction terms.
Mode 2 adds an indication whether your X and Z coordinates will Increase or Decrease if you move in the direction you are facing.
Mode 3 also shows the Biome that you are currently in, displayed below the coordinates.
Mode 4 adds the Minecraft Day counter, shown as 'dy'
Mode 4 replaces the normal X, Y and Z coordinates with Chunk information:
This shows which Chunk you are in, and which Block within that Chunk
The display appears with the Chunk being denoted by a 'c' and the Block by a 'b'.

## Batty's Stopwatch Timer

A discreet timer tucked away in a corner of the screen, that you can hide, reappear, stop, start and zero using key presses.
Can be used to time activities in-game. Useful for speed challenges.
Shows the time passed in hours, minutes and seconds.
Colour-coded so you know at a glance if it is stopped or running.

## Info Panel
This display will show either the FPS, the Block Light-level or the Moon phase. You can switch between these at the press of a button.

FPS Display

Block Light-level
The block light (i.e. artificial light reaching this block) of the block the player is standing on is displayed

An icon, showing the current phase of the moon, is displayed.
